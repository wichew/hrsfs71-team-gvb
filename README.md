# GvB
Good must triumph. The missions must succeed. By completing missions, Good will become one step closer to success yet Bad has cursed some of the good, ready for sabotage. Good must unmask them in five missions. We are Good!

GvB is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. GvB is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.

Players are either Good or Bad. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Power entrusts a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself) to a mission. Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to support or sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Good win) or fails (Bad win). When a team wins a majority of missions, they have won the game.
